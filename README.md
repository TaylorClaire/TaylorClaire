Cytometry in R

Location : Leeds, United Kingdom

My favourite fluorophore : BUV395

Previous coding experience : I've done quite a lot of data wrangling and visualisation in R but pretty much entirely self taught.

What I hope to get from this course : new ideas to help me with both flow cytometry analysis and R coding.
